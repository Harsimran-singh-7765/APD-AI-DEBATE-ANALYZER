    "Speaker 1": """As Prime Minister, I stand to support the motion that this House would abolish alimony payments post-divorce. In modern society where we advocate gender equality, alimony perpetuates the outdated notion that women are financially dependent on men. It reinforces the patriarchal mindset that women cannot stand on their own feet. We propose instead to empower all individuals ‚Äî regardless of gender ‚Äî with access to state-funded upskilling programs post-divorce, especially homemakers. This is not anti-women; it‚Äôs pro-independence. Alimony is a band-aid, not a cure. Let‚Äôs end dependence, not sustain it.""",

    "Speaker 2": """As Deputy Prime Minister, I will elaborate. First, alimony is often weaponized. There are growing cases of misuse where financially stable individuals continue to receive payments just because the law mandates it. Second, the system is inherently sexist ‚Äî rarely do men receive alimony even if they were homemakers. Equality is not about reversing roles but eliminating the imbalance altogether. In the UK, reforms are already considering replacing alimony with transitional support funds. We are not removing support; we are making it neutral, need-based, and temporary.""",

    "Speaker 3": """As Government Whip, I will rebut the opposition‚Äôs emotional narrative and crystallize our stance. The other side will claim that homemakers, often women, will suffer. But the real problem is that the system forces them into a passive role even after divorce. We propose active rehabilitation, not lifelong dependency. Moreover, alimony rarely reaches those who truly need it due to legal delays and manipulation. This motion is about evolution. We are not abandoning vulnerable people ‚Äî we are upgrading support in a feminist framework. That‚Äôs real progress.""",

    "Speaker 4": """As Leader of Opposition, I strongly oppose this motion. Alimony exists because financial and social inequalities still persist. In India, 70% of women who divorce after being full-time homemakers find it hard to rejoin the workforce. Saying "get a job" post-divorce without structural support is cruel. The state doesn‚Äôt have adequate upskilling infra yet. Until equality is achieved in hiring, pay, and opportunity ‚Äî alimony acts as a necessary bridge. To abolish it now is to abandon vulnerable individuals under the illusion of equality.""",

    "Speaker 5": """As Deputy Leader of Opposition, let me dismantle the proposal further. The proposition paints an ideal world. In reality, a homemaker in her 40s, out of the workforce for decades, cannot magically become employable. And let‚Äôs talk about power. Often, men pressure women to waive alimony for quicker divorces or custody. Removing legal protection just tips the power dynamic further against women. Even in the West, such as the U.S., reforms have been cautious and gradual ‚Äî not abrupt. We need reform, not removal.""",

    "Speaker 6": """As Opposition Whip, I summarize our case. The proposition‚Äôs model is built on assumptions ‚Äî state funding, neutral support, ideal feminism ‚Äî none of which currently exists. They speak of abuse of alimony; we speak of the abuse that happens **without** it. Their best case is that a few misuse it. Our worst case is lifelong poverty for the vulnerable. Until we have true structural parity, alimony remains a **necessary evil**. We win this debate on **pragmatism**, **gender justice**, and **real-world empathy**."""
